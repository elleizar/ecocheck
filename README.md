# ecocheck

## description
We created an app in React Native and Python Flask where people can change their lifestyles to become more eco-conscious. With the recent rise in thrifting and ethical shopping, many people are more critical about the products they buy and how they are made. We want our app to be the place for people to be able to explore new businesses that operate sustainably and help continue to push this trend towards eco-conscious shopping. 

## features
The main features that our app will include is a map where a user can select the store that they have purchased from and enter what category of item they bought and the store's name. If that business already has a profile on our app then it will have a rating and information about how eco-friendly it is and also why they are considered eco-friendly (we would have businesses apply to be hosted on our app). The user can also rate their experience at that business which will help smaller businesses who are struggling during these times. On the other hand, if the business is not in our database then we can recommend stores that are based on the type of item the user purchased. In the future we would verify these purchases/transactions by linking to the user's bank rewards card. By shopping at more eco-friendly businesses, users will be able to earn more rewards!

## motivation
We were motivated to make this project because we want to see cities (and the entire world) grow to become more sustainable. We want our app to help make changes in the lifestyle of our users and show them ways that they can spend their money and be more eco-friendly. We want our users to be trendsetters to show other businesses and people that striving for sustainable and ethical products is important. We also want our app to be a tool for businesses to educate their customers on the manufacturing of their products and make them think more about where they spend their money!
